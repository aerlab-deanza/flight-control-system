# Flight Control Simulator

Python-based quadcopter dynamics and control simulator

## Purpose
Design and tune cascaded PID controllers before deploying to hardware. Validate:
- Control stability
- Filter effectiveness
- Performance metrics (overshoot, settling time)
- Disturbance rejection

## Running
**Basic simulation.**
