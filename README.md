# flight-control-system

End-to-end quadcopter UAC development repository (mechanical + electrical + software + validation).

## What this is
This repo is a shared engineering workspace for building a quadcopter UAV from first principles:
- Mechanical design assets (CAD and fabrication exports)
- Electronics and power documentation (wiring, power budget, integration notes)
- Flight software (embedded firmware, estimation + control)
- Simulation and analysis tooling (for test, tuning, and validation)
- Documentation and test evidence (architecture notes, procedures, logs)

## Repository map (beginning)
- `hardware/` - CAD, BOM, electronics/power docs
- `firmware/` - embedded flight software
- `simulator/` - dynamics + sensor simulation
- `analysis/` - scripts/notebooks for logs + metrics
- `docs/` - architecutre notes, procedures, test plans
- `logs/` - sample logs + log format docs

## Getting Started
1. Skim `docs/` for the current architecture notes and conventions
2. Choose an area to contribute (hardware / firmware / simulation / analysis).
3. Create a brancy and add your work with a short folder-level README.
